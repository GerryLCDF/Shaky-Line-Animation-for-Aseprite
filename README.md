### ⚙️ **Installation:**

*1️⃣ Download.

*2️⃣ Open Aseprite → File → Scripts → Open Scripts Folder.

*3️⃣ Paste the `.lua` file inside the folder.

*4️⃣ Restart Aseprite — you'll see "Shaky Line Animation" under the Scripts menu.

### ✅ **How to use:**

* Select your layer (or choose "ALL Layers" to affect all visible layers).
* Set how many extra frames you want.
* Adjust shake and density to taste.
* Run the script — done! You now have a jittery, hand-drawn style animation.

### ✨ **What it does:**

* Creates multiple frames automatically to simulate a shaky animation.
* Works on a single layer or **all layers** at once.
* Lets you control:

  * **Frames:** How many extra animation frames to create.
  * **Shake amount:** How much each pixel moves (recommended: small values for subtle effect).
  * **Density:** How many copies are drawn per pixel to make lines more solid.

💡 If you try it out, feel free to share your results or suggest improvements! I'd love to see what other artists do with it.
Hope it helps someone make their pixel art even more expressive! 😊
